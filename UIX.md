The work ahead of us now is a UX refactorming essentially, we're going to simplify it, make it cleaner, provide it with consistent navigation, and work on a more consistent, less jarring visual color scheme.

The refactoring won't touch Python code; it is entirely to be handled if possible in the templates and styles part of the application. There's a significant amount of JavaScript that needs to be maintained because it's acting, reacting, or working with existing routes of the Flask application. So we'll pay special attention to the `JavaScript`, not to break it or overlook it as we update the templates.

The best example of a page that got a bit crazy is the admin page. All those sections and buttons are mostly logically controlled in their own little extra boxes, but I don't think a professional-looking admin page should look like that. It should be cleaner, maybe with sub-navigation. It's a quick app, so if you know what you're doing, you can go click-click to where you want to go faster than click-scroll. Get the idea? And those buttons and everything, they're just too big.

I do like the idea though that the app is reactive to the phone as opposed to a desktop surface where it gracefully changes itself, whatever that's called, responsive.

Okay, what do I like?
- The home page is nice
- The navigation tree there works well  We won't mess with that.

Although on the home page of how we display system status, inventory status, admin and quick start links, additional links we may want to revisit.Once we have hundreds of inventory items, that's a deep scroll to find. Maybe we hide them under the title "Inventory" at the very top in the title bar as clickable.

I do like the item page. The top title bar is good. The chevron little arrow thingy pointing to back we would talk about. But the images are good. The description there, the move item, the add photo, that's all above the fold before they start using the app. So that's good on an iPhone anyways.Then all that's left is the image controls (delete item) and back at the bottom again we need to find a cleaner style for all of our buttons. When I say cleaner, maybe I'm imagining less harsh, more transparency. Feeling just less in your face. The images and the description and the content that's there is more important than the buttons, if that makes sense.

I don't think we want to change the modal popups; they're doing their job. There may be opportunities to take advantage of global color scheming for buttons and stuff, but let's not mess with them. Let's keep an eye on the fact that we're doing something, and there was some code to strip the HTML or render the HTML properly or strip the HTML and render it as text in those dialogues because otherwise we got BR and PRE and we saw HTML tags raw. That's so that's been we don't want to break that we don't want that artifact to come back.

The navigation at the top of the item page. I'd like that back arrow thingy to take you back the cookie crumb hierarchy of the items embeddedness. I don't know what the word for it is.This item could be linked inside another item inside another item that's on the homepage, right? There's a hierarchy here.Even if you get to this item through search and you drop straight on it, saying it was a box that's in the garage and you hit back. It should go to the garage, and you hit back on the garage, and then that would go home. Does that make sense? We'd like to follow the cookie crumbs backwards no matter how we got to the item.If that's a code change, let's make a note of it and keep it to the side. We'll do it last.Meaning if that's Flask code that needs to be updated.

The system stats page is pretty clean.However, it lacks any navigation.It's consumable though, it's nice and short on an iPhone.The admin linked pages or items we should be looking at trying to keep things short, consumable, and easily back to the admin page to look for other stuff.I don't want it to be a whole web of links though, right? We got to try and avoid that.Again, the remote access setup is nice and clean, but it has no navigation elements.And then there's the back button that's on some of these pages. It's big and it's black and it's ugly. It should be small and more a glyph icon graphic suggesting back than the word back.It doesn't have to be intuitive for people. Well, I think the icon would be intuitive, and they'll figure it out. They won't have to have any more cognitive load once they figure out that we have a consistent back button. The only one that's going to act differently than they normally expect is that one on the inventory page that I just discussed.Otherwise, a back button will take you to the previous page you were on, whatever that might be.

Another page is the inventory stats. Again, it's kinda clean. However, it's way too airy; it must be far more compact.And as part of the navigation, obviously it needs consistency with whatever we come up with.

So when possible, an element to drive backwards would be on the title because if a page has any length to it, scrolling to the bottom just to click back is a severe inconvenience.However, taking up all the space in the title is something that we have to be cognizant of. Right now, it's nice and compact, the home page is just about perfect.That's why I suggested we heat up the word inventory to use it as a sort of subtle or hidden way to get to the admin pages.Or generally the rest of the settings and stuff that we have, maybe.

That's a lot, so I think from this we could distill a solid plan of what needs to be done to enhance the UI.
