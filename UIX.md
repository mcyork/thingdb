This file is trying to outline the items and issues I see with the user experience.Mostly, we need to simplify the interfaces in the admin pages and create consistent navigation.Work on a global color scheme.And styles, buttons, and everything.We have three main areas where we work:
1. On the home page, and that's looking pretty good.The other is in items, and that's looking reasonably good. But there's room for improvement. Make it a little sharper, a little cleaner.And then there's all the extra pages, inventories, admin status, those things.

Let's not mess with item's title bar; it's working.Except for one minor feature.The title bar has what looks like an arrow (back button) on it, and it works, but it takes you to the home page.My preference is if you've jumped deep into the tree, so to speak, it will breadcrumb you back, and when you're on a base item, it will then take you to the home page. Does that make sense?
