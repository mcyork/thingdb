We've got some user feedback.

When you select the plus sign to add a new item, the title should be defaulted to be in edit mode so that they can type in the title because they always have to go and change it anyways.


May need to revisit the versioning? It works but requires a reboot.Perhaps we add a safe reboot button to the admin page and call it done.

We'd like to add a non-breaking change to add a URL to the item. A user-defined URL could be added.And then clicked.And perhaps multiple URLs.This one has to carefully expand the schema of the database without changing anything about existing links or columns.
